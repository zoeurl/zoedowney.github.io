<p>zoÃ« downey (1995) is a <a href="https://www.zoedowney.com/photography/">photographer</a> and <a href="https://www.zoedowney.com/writing/">writer</a> based in hertfordshire.
</p>
she documents quiet scenes and everyday ephemera that invite digital preservation. she also critiques cinema and contemporary media.
</p>
imagery is <em>the</em> concern across her work, paired with the critical discourse that orbits it. her present focus is on subtler movements of street photography and minimalist details of still-life. within the chaos and complexity of modern-day living, she seeks to frame moments of calm, serenity and visual order.
