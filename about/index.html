my process:
</p>
imagery is <em>the</em> concern across my work, paired with the critical discourse that orbits it. in taking photos, my present focus is on minimalist details of still-life and subtler movements of street photography. to me, this process is about noticing and zeroing-in on the smaller—but significant—ordinary.
</p>
working with my dslr and android phone, I seek to frame moments of calm, serenity and visual order within the chaos and complexity of modern-day living.
