<p>zoë downey is a <a href="https://www.zoedowney.com/photography/">photographer</a> and <a href="https://www.zoedowney.com/writing/">writer</a> based in hertfordshire.
</p>
she documents quiet scenes and everyday ephemera that invite digital preservation. she also critiques cinema and contemporary media.
</p>
imagery is <em>the</em> concern across her work, paired with the critical discourse that orbits it. her present focus is on minimalist details of still-life and subtler movements of street photography. this process involves zeroing-in on the smaller—but significant—ordinary. she seeks to frame moments of calm, serenity and visual order within the chaos and complexity of modern-day living.
</p>
she is a master's graduate of goldsmiths in english and american literature. she specialised in animated films of america and japan.
