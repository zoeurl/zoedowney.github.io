my process:
</p>
imagery is <em>the</em> concern across my work, paired with the critical discourse that orbits it. in taking photos, my present focus is on minimalist details of still-life and subtler movements of street photography. to me, this process is about noticing and zeroing-in on the smaller—but significant—ordinary.
</p>
working simply with my dslr and android phone, I seek to frame moments of calm, serenity and visual order within the chaos and complexity of modern-day living.

about me:
</p>
my love for photography was sparked by my dad's interest in lomography and my grandmother's eye for composition as a painter and printmaker. this joy found in capturing and documenting image was later rekindled during a month-long trip to japan in 2019.
</p>
I currently work in the education sector. I earned my first-class bachelor's (hons) in english from goldsmiths, university of london in 2017.
</p>
in 2020, I graduated with a master's in american literature & culture. I specialised in ecocriticism surrounding american and japanese animation.
</p>
thank you for passing through; I'm glad to be here.
