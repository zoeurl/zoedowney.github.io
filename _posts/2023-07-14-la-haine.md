The estate is home to families, graffiti and loud music. In a cameo,[ DJ Cut Killer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js2_hBDi2LI&ab_channel=Denuf) splices together ‘Sound of da Police’ by KRS-One and Édith Piaf’s ‘Non, je ne regrette rien’. It echoes from his apartment into the courtyard — this is gritty 90s Paris. The camera floats from speakers towards the sky like unruly sound waves.

Against this scenery, Vinz, Hubert and Saïd (Cassel, Koundé and Taghmaoui) navigate the aftermath of riots that occurred the previous night. Each carries a justifiably ‘nique la police’ overtone, drawn from personal outrage. Trigger-happy Vinz seeks revenge. He’s found a missing police gun amidst the chaos of the protests. He tucks it into his jeans in a *tough-guy* move.

Vinz fights with Hubert  about his more careful attitude to cops. Saïd plays arbitrator between their conflicting temperaments. A stinging reference to the[ Rodney King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King) tragedy is thrown into the ring. *La Haine* is not shy about demonstrating the tense relationship between police and public. Indeed, with respect to the consequences of hitting back against the law, there is an awareness of the privileges held by some over others.

Oppressive measures come in subtler forms. The three guys hang out on the rooftops with friends. Cops arrive to break up the harmless gathering; one of them has ‘NOTRE DAME’ emblazoned on his jacket. Aesthetic details are strengthened by the choice to film in black and white. The harsh visual contrast highlights a performative type of masculinity.

Characters have intense discussions in public toilets and psych themselves up by talking into mirrors. Over the bathroom sink, Vinz points finger guns at his image in a gesture of machismo borrowed from[ Taxi Driver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQkpes3dgzg&ab_channel=DontHateOnJord): ‘You talkin’ to me, mothafucka!’ In defying authority there is a great helping of masculine pride at stake.

Hubert, Vinz and Saïd take the train into central Paris. They rest on a balcony and the camera swerves into a dolly zoom against a backdrop of traffic and lights. It refocuses on the men and the city blurs behind them. *La Haine* speaks of a wider geographical and political context told through a narrower field of view — the cultural specificities and personal struggles of its three protagonists.

Comedy is dished out in small doses; a gentle compromise between sobering moments and gentle humor. Even so, the sociopolitical undertone is ever-present; a darkness that is foregrounded as events play on. The story is, after all, about three guys in Paris with a stolen Chekhov’s gun. It’s a matter of if — or when — it will go off.
